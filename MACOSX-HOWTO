BUILDING JARCHDVD FOR MAC OS X

NOTE: This has only been tested with 10.4.0 "Tiger". Results
      may vary in earlier versions.

1. Go to the "utilities" section and run the Terminal
   application.
2. Unpack this tarball somewhere.
3. Type "make clean". DO NOT USE "make" the default Makefile
   is geared to assume Linux!
4. Type "./build-macosx". This will run a shell script that
   runs "make" using an alternate Makefile designed
   specifically for Mac OS X and the IOKit framework.
5. Type "sudo make install". This will install jarchdvd
   to your /usr/bin directory so that you can use it anywhere
   (as can any user).

Under Linux and Windows running JarchDVD is as simple
as CDing to the directory that you want to rip the data to.
Unfortunately MacOS X is a little too automated with the
system resources to make it this easy, so here is how you
do it:

1. Bring up the Terminal program (under utilities)
2. Insert the DVD you want to rip (if not done already)
3. Type "diskutil list" to list all mounted drives. Look
   for the DVD in the list (on my Mac Mini this is shown
   as disk1)
4. Type "diskutil unmount disk1". The icon for the DVD
   should disappear from your desktop.
5. CD to the directory that you want to rip to and
   run JarchDVD. If Mac OS X truly unmounted the drive
   JarchDVD should have no problems ripping the disc.

NOTE: The instant JarchDVD finishes or is terminated,
      Mac OS X will almost immediately remount the DVD
      and the icon will reappear on your desktop. To
      re-rip or finish ripping start from step 4 again.
